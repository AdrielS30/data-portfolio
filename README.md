# 📊 Data Analysis Portfolio

Thank you for viewing my data analysis portfolio! This repo includes three projects that showcase my ability to find insights, trends, and correlations in the fields of solar power and political engagement. These finding are obtained through the practices of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Explore Transform Load (ETL) processes, and statistical testing. Tools and techniques used are:

- Python:
    - pandas, seaborn and matplotlib libraries
    - Data collection
- SQL:
    - Database management
    - Querying and filtering
- Statistics:
    - Hypothesis testing
    - Distribution analysis
    - Correlation analysis
- Storytelling:
    - Communicating insights through data-driven narratives
- Tableau:
    - Dynamic dashboards
